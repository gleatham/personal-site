      <h3>Bio</h3>
      <p>Film making, programming, and IT have been a part of my life since I can remember.
      Throughout middle school and high school I attempted to teach myself c++ with very little
      success. It wasn't until I discovered python that I really started to get good at programming.
      I have written desktop apps using tkinter and pyqt. Other technologies I have used include
      Django, Pandas, CSS, Javascript, and many others.</p>
      <p>My love of film started in elementary school but I didn't start making films until middle
      school when my mom bought the family a video camera. I made a few short films but didn't
      start refining my craft until my junior year of highschool. I will linke some of those early
      videos here. Since I have had the opportunity to shoot web ads, TV commercials, feature
      length documentaries, and several short films.</p>
      <p>I have used programming professionally as a Linux admin to write scripts as well as
      programs that have helped us to manage files, keep track of changes using hashing, and
      ensure that everything on our servers is configured properly.</p>
      <p>I am currently working as a systems administrator but do film and IT consulting on the side.
      Feel free to reach out with any questions. Thanks for reading!</p>
