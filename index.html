      <h3>Bio</h3>
      <p>Hello and welcome to my site. My name is Geoff Leatham. I am a full-time Linux Admin who gets
      lucky enough to do some development work from time to time and a part-time filmmaker.</p>
      <p>I started my IT career in 2014 working as a Web Advisor. I was fortunate to get my first real
      taste of Linux there and quickly became hooked. After working there for less than a year I was laid
      off along with the rest of the staff in Utah as they were moving their operations to Arizona.</p>
      <p>After that I took a job doing desktop support working for a government contractor supporting the
      VA. I worked there for about a year until it was announced that they were losing the contract and
      everyone was getting laid off. After being laid off from two different tech jobs I decided to take
      a chance and do freelance video production work.</p>
      <p>After freelancing for a bit I began working in IT again for another web hosting company. During all
          of this time I never stopped tinkering with Linux and that led me to a role as a Jr Linux Admin.
          I was able to quickly work my way up the ranks and I am currently working as a Sr. Linux Admin.</p>
